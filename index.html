				<h2>What DO WE DO?</h2>

<p>It may seem extremely expensive, utterly useless and pretty much completely unaffordable for most people.. and thats because it is.</p>

				<h2>Modern japanese technology</h2>

				<p> Being a company founded in japan, despite our services expanding to almost everywhere in the universe our main HQ is still stationed and run in the beautiful technologically advanced city of Tokyo.</p>
					<p> In our early days this HQ was well known in the japanese community for being quite an eyesore as it being a Stellar engine control/management site and a launch site for various satellites and shuttles meant it needed to be rather large and made of pure concrete, metal and glass.</p>
						<p>Throughout our existence, designers and architects have worked almost non-stop to make our building a cultural landmark rather than a distraction and as of right now, the difference in appearance is night and day. Our whole district is now a wonderful homage to japanese culture and tradition, with copious amounts of asian flora, art and designs incorporated into our main building and surrounding area.</p>

	<p> Our logo is a star that's so far in the distance that you can only see the trail.</p>
