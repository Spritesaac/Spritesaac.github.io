				<h2>Want to work for us?</h2>
				<p>Here at Constellation Co. we only hire the most committed of workers as a single slip up can cost us up to trillions of dollars. Therefor our educational prerequisites are extremely strict but you are given so much money in return that itll all be worth it.</p>
				<p>Of course theres a catch, as with most contracts created by giant conglomerate companies, though it all depends on what department you are stationed at.</p>
				<p>We have 3 main departments of work in our business, below are the expectations of working in each one.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Constellation Designer</li>
					<li>HQ stationed Engineer or Scientist</li>
					<li>Stellar Engine Stationed Operator</li>
				</ul>
<p>Being a Constellation Designer means that you are in charge of designing the shapes and large scale art that will be plastered throughout the universe. You get to work from home and will only be in crunch time 70% of the time! This may seem like a large percentage but most companies make their workers work in crunch mode 90% of the time. Consider this lowered percentage as an act of generosity.</p>
				<p>Being a HQ Stationed Engineer or Scientist means that you are in charge of the workshoping and creation of any technology and chemicals we need for our large scale space traversal plans. You will work at our HQ almost every day on average working hours, with an occasional day or two where you can work from home if you want to as your work day may be dedicated completely to design and blueprint creation.</p>
				<p>Being a Stellar Engine Stationed Operator means that you are in charge with operating our Stellar Engine! This is by far the most important job we provide out of the 3 as it comes with 2 positions, both being optional. You can either work on site at our HQ in our control room to survey all the working parts of the stellar engine and make sure everything is up to code with a team of 50 other experienced workers. Or alternatively you can work on the bridge of the stellar engine, carrying out orders and maintaining it as it creates our masterpieces of art. Of course this second postion comes at a small, tiny, miniscule price of living your entire life in space, far away from the rest of humanity and all your loved ones.</p>
				<p>Our company's motto: Taking 'shoot for the stars' literally.</p>
